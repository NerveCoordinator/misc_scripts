for ubuntu 19.04

using this guide https://askubuntu.com/questions/1094443/ubuntu-18-04-1-lts-r9-390x-amdgpu-guide-testing-summary 
do NOT download the driver. Instead, install proprietary drivers on install (this gives you amdgpu)

in /etc/default/grub
use this line:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="radeon.si_support=0 radeon.cik_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1 amdgpu.cik_support=1 amdgpu.dc=1 amdgpu.modeset=1" 
  note: this instructions include "amdgpu.dpm=1", but I am unsure if it was removing this, or not downloading the drivers that finally worked
you don't even need to blacklist radeon.

sudo apt install vulkan-tools
